# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: "Star Wars" }, { name: "Lord of the Rings" }])
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)

# student = Student.create(

#   first_name: "Ismail",
#   last_name: "Ahmed",
#   email: "mdismailcse26@gmail.com",
# )


# 20.times do |i|
#   Student.create(
#     first_name: "student#{i + 1}",
#     last_name: "last_name#{i + 1}",
#     email: "#{i + 1}studentmail@gmail.com",
#   )
# end


# Student.all.each do |student|
#     student.blogs.create(title: "this is the blog for this student #{student.id}", content: "this is the content for this student #{student.first_name}")

#     student.blogs.create(title: "this is the blog for this student #{student.id+200}", content: "this is the content for this student #{student.first_name}")
